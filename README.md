# The FarmStand
### The FarmStand is a project by Justin Aiello for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive.
### A link to the app can be found [here](https://the-farm-stand.herokuapp.com/).
##### The idea behind the app is to give shoppers a chance to reserve the best produce at the farmers market from their favorite farmers and show up to market whenever they would like to rather than try to get up extra early to get the best picks.
##### The app uses the following:
1. Node.js
⋅⋅*Express
⋅⋅*bCryptJS
⋅⋅*EJS
3. jQuery
4. Mongoose
5. MongoDB
##### Files have been structured using MVC formatting. There are also folders for public JS and CSS files as well as a folder for custom middleware.
##### There are two collections used in the databse:
1. Users Model to store user data which is salted and hashed using bCrypt before it enters the database.
2. Products to store data on available vegetables.
